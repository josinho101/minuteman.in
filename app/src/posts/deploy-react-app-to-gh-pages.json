Yes, you are right. In react applications we will have lot of components and other files we might be linking to our project which on deployments we will transpile/bundle them to javascript chunks files which will be linked to our html files. </p><p> Then, how we are going to deploy it? The answer is a package called <b>gh-page</b>. This package has the ability to push output from our build process. </p><p><b>Things needed before we start</b></p><ul> <li> <a href='https: //github.com/' target='_blank'>GitHub</a> account </li><li> <a href='https://git-scm.com/' target='_blank'>Git client</a> on your local machine </li><li> <a href='https://nodejs.org/en/' target='_blank'>Node.js</a> (latest version) </li><li> <a href='https://nodejs.org/en/' target='_blank' >Node package manager</a > (will come as part of nodejs installation) </li></ul> <p><b>Steps to deploy react application</b></p><ol> <li>Create a repository in your GitHub account.</li><li> Sync the newly created repository in to your local computer. </li><li> Initialize react application using <a href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app' >create-react-app</a >.
